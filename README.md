<h1 align="center">~ Hello there! I'm Tahmeed Tarek ~</h1>

I work in tech and love building the occasional automation which takes me 6 hrs to reclaim 15 mins of mundane tasks. As of 2025 I'm at Meta working in Infrastructure Security but if you're reading this in the future take it with a grain of timestamp. I completed my undergrad on **Computer Science & Engineering** from _[BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/)_. Besides tech I'm also fairly invested in movies & animes, photography, traveling and discussing regular pseudo-intellectual topics like philosophy, psychology and politics. I wish I was more active on Github but `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` sorry


### 🧑‍💻 My Tech!

I've worked on a bunch of projects for over the years, tried out different roles and discovered that I prefer working more on systems & infrastructure. I've always loved diving deep, tinkering and building things so working in tech has always been a great opportunity for me to channel that passion.   

I was fortunate to expirement with these stuff (at least the ones off the top of my head that I could find fancy badges for)  ~
