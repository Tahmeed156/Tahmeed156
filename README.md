<h1 align="center">~ Hello there! I'm Tahmeed Tarek ~</h1>

I'm currently doing my undergrad on **Computer Science & Engineering** at _[BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/)_ and also work as a **backend developer**. Besides tech I'm also fairly invested in movies & animes, playing cards, reading and regular pseudo-intellectual topics like philosophy, psychology and politics.

> 💡 *I'm interested in part-time work, internships and research opportunities (where I can learn a lot) in the domain of backend development, systems programming or server administration so hit me up if you know of any interesting opportunities!*

### 🧑‍💻 My Tech!

- **Backend** - `django` `flask` `sqlaclchemy` `SQL` `postgres`
- **API** - `django-rest-framework` `postman` `swagger` `graphql`
- **Devops** - `AWS` `docker` `pytest` `git` `heroku` `linux` `bash`
- **Frontend** - `react` `gatsby` `bootstrap` `react-native` 

I've worked on a bunch of projects for over 3 years now and discovered that I prefer working more on the systems and backend side of things. To that end I've recently been 🔭 **learning more about systems programming languages, distributed systems, databases and devops**. But these interests may very well evolve (except `python` that's usually a constant) by the time you're reading this!

### 🌱 Cool things that I explored in the past ~
- Blockchain (DAPP) development on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) (Solidity, Truffle) and [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric)!
- Computer Vision (Optical Character Recognition) with [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)!
- Andrew NG's amazing [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)!
- Building mobile apps with [React-native](https://reactnative.dev/)!
- Object Oriented Programming with Java, [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) and [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/orm/)!
- Learning [Assembly](https://github.com/Tahmeed156/Assembly-Sessional) (Intel 8086) & building a [Compiler](https://github.com/Tahmeed156/Compiler-Sessional) (flex-bison)!
