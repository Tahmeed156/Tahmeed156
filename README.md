<h1 align="center">~ Hello there! I'm Tahmeed Tarek ~</h1>

I'm currently working at [Chaldal](https://chaldal.tech/) as a Software Engineer in the Infrastructure team.  I've completed my undergrad on **Computer Science & Engineering** at _[BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/)_. Besides tech I'm also fairly invested in movies & animes, reading, playing cards and discussing regular pseudo-intellectual topics like philosophy, psychology and politics.

> 💡 *I'm open to new opportunities in the domain of backend engineering, systems, cloud & networking!*

### 🧑‍💻 My Tech!

- **Backend** - `ASP.NET` `Redis` `gRPC / Protobuf` `Django` `Flask` `Express.js`
- **Infra** - `Azure Service Fabric` `AWS` `Docker` `Linux, Bash`
- **Database** - `SQL Server` `SQL` `PostgreSQL` `SQLAlchemy`
- **Tools** - `Git` `Application Insights Telemetry` `Pytest` 
- **Languages** - `.NET (C# / F#)` `Python` `Javscript` `Go` `Rust`

I've worked on a bunch of projects for over 5 years now (over 2 years professionally) and discovered that I prefer working more on the backends & infrastructure. To that end I've recently been 🔭 **learning more about distributed systems, databases, networking and infrastructure tooling**.
